# DBM Game Engine

## Members
This engine was made by David Lee and Brickson Cain.

## Notable Features
We designed the engine with the main goals being the simulation of 3d in a 2d engine, and joypad input.  We thought that these would be fun to apply to different genres, with David wanting to make a platformer and Brickson wanting to make a Pole Position-style racing game.

## Current State
The engine can draw circles, squares and lines, all taking their typical 2-dimensional inputs as well as depth inputs.  As the depth value gets larger, the object is drawn smaller and smaller, and is positioned closer and closer to the center of the screen, mimicing a one-point perspective drawing.  B_Racer (by Brickson Cain) currently demonstrates these features of the engine by drawing a background that mimics a road with lines moving toward the camera and a simple car, making it seem like the camera is following a car as it drives down the tunnel.  There are now opponent cars as well, which move towards the horizon at different speeds depending on the speed of the player's car.

The engine supports input from keyboard and joystick. Keyboard can detect keys. Joystick can detect if a joystick is connected, if a button is pressed, and what the current axis position is.

Key 2D platformer features such as importing tile map, sprite sheet, animation, collision, detect area enter and text pringing is supported.
